# School Projects Repository

This repository contains documentation for school projects I worked on including my thesis. Below, you will find a brief overview of each project along with my specific responsibilities.

## 1. Bachelor's thesis (FIRST DRAFT)
### Overview
A first draft of my Bachelor's thesis for which I worked full-time in the Nanomaterials Group at Aalto University, during which I conducted experiments, analyzed data and wrote the thesis. The thesis covers the effect of carbon disulfide as a sulfur source in the synthesis and characteristics of carbon nanotubes in floating-catalyst chemical vapor deposition.

## 2. Hand Movement Controlled Mouse, ELEC-A4910 (Finnish Presentation Only)

### Overview
The Hand Movement Controlled Mouse project focuses on creating a computer mouse control system based on hand movements. The project documentation, presented in Finnish, outlines the development process, implementation details, outcomes, and a presentation video as well as the code. The link to the video is accessible by downloading the pdf-file. This project was done in a group of four.

### Responsibilities
My main responsibility was in coding the software for the project and I also contributed to the development of the electrical components.

## 3. Air quality machine learning project, CS-C3240

### Overview
The Machine Learning Project involves the application of regression to predict the air quality index in Helsinki. The documentation provides insights into the methods used, results obtained and the project code. This project was done in a pair.

### Responsibilities
For this project, I was responsible for coding the machine learning algorithms. Additionally, I was responsible for drafting the "Methods" and "Results" sections of the documentation.

## 4. X-ray diffraction laboratory report (Finnish only), PHYS-C0310

### Overview
This report was a part of a lab course which included experimental measurements and a scientific report based on those. The measurements were done in pairs and the report was fully written by me. The report is only available in Finnish.

## 5. Sandpile laboratory report, PHYS-C0310

### Overview
This report was a part of a lab course which included experimental measurements and a scientific report based on those. The measurements were done in pairs and the report was fully written by me.
